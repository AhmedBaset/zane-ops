# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables multiple users to collaborate on projects by allowing project owners to invite other users and manage their access permissions. Currently, projects are restricted to a single owner, limiting collaboration capabilities. This enhancement will introduce a flexible permission system that maintains security while enabling team collaboration on projects, services, and deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to invite other users to collaborate on my project, so that my team can work together on deployments and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project owner accesses project settings THEN the system SHALL display a "Team Members" or "Collaborators" section
2. WHEN a project owner clicks "Invite User" THEN the system SHALL provide a form to enter user email or username
3. WHEN a project owner submits a valid user invitation THEN the system SHALL send an invitation to the specified user
4. WHEN an invited user accepts the invitation THEN the system SHALL grant them access to the project
5. IF the invited user does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want to receive and respond to project invitations, so that I can join projects I'm invited to work on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a project invitation THEN the system SHALL notify them via email or in-app notification
2. WHEN a user views their pending invitations THEN the system SHALL display all pending project invitations
3. WHEN a user accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL add them as a project collaborator
4. WHEN a user declines an invitation THEN the system SHALL remove the invitation and notify the project owner
5. WHEN a user accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the project dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to manage collaborator permissions, so that I can control what actions team members can perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project owner views team members THEN the system SHALL display each member's current role and permissions
2. WHEN a project owner changes a collaborator's role THEN the system SHALL update their permissions immediately
3. WHEN a project owner removes a collaborator THEN the system SHALL revoke their access to the project
4. IF a collaborator attempts an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate message
5. WHEN permissions are changed THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want to access project resources based on my permissions, so that I can contribute effectively while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a collaborator views the projects list THEN the system SHALL display all projects they own or have access to
2. WHEN a collaborator accesses a project THEN the system SHALL show only the features and actions they're permitted to use
3. WHEN a collaborator attempts to perform an action THEN the system SHALL verify their permissions before allowing it
4. IF a collaborator lacks permission for an action THEN the system SHALL display a clear permission denied message
5. WHEN a collaborator's permissions change THEN the system SHALL update their access in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data security and access control, so that project collaboration doesn't compromise system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are added to projects THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all permission changes
2. WHEN a user is removed from a project THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke all their access tokens and sessions for that project
3. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL verify access in real-time without caching sensitive permission data
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events for review
5. WHEN a project owner account is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to transfer ownership safely

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to define different permission levels, so that I can give appropriate access to different team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up collaborator roles THEN the system SHALL support at minimum: Owner, Admin, Developer, and Viewer roles
2. WHEN a user has Owner role THEN they SHALL have full access including user management and project deletion
3. WHEN a user has Admin role THEN they SHALL manage services and deployments but not user permissions
4. WHEN a user has Developer role THEN they SHALL deploy services and view logs but not modify project settings
5. WHEN a user has Viewer role THEN they SHALL only view project status and logs without making changes
