  - [ ] deploy service  
    - [ ] Building service with nixpacks  
  - [ ] archive service
  - [ ] Pull Request environments
  - [ ] Auto-comments with deployment status on github
- [ ] Git services frontend (same as docker services)

## üöÄ Features

- **Deploy Web Services**: Unleash your creativity by deploying web apps, starting a REDIS instance, creating a
  PostgreSQL database, initiating a Bitcoin node, and more. It's your resources, go crazy!
- **Git Push Deployment**: Automatically deploy apps from GitHub on push. Seamless and efficient.
- **Preview Deployments**: Easily manage app versions, roll back to any version at any time, and control storage
  duration‚Äîwhether indefinitely or temporarily post-merge.
- **Deploy Workers**: Ideal for one-off tasks that are removed post-execution.
- **Deploy CRONs**: Automate recurring tasks by pinging endpoints or running commands regularly.
- **Scaling**: Effortlessly scale your app to manage traffic spikes, up or down.

## üçô Getting Started

You can follow the steps in [here](./docs/deploying.md).

## üìö Terminologies

- **Worker**: A lightweight, ephemeral unit of work or process designed to run a specific task. Workers are typically
  utilized for one-off or background tasks that execute and then terminate upon completion.

- **Service**: A persistent, scalable component of an application that runs continuously. Services act as the backbone
  of your application, managing HTTP requests, executing background jobs, interfacing with databases, and more.

- **CRON**: A scheduling system for executing tasks (known as CRON jobs) at specified times or intervals. There are two
  types of CRON jobs:
    - **Command CRONs**: These jobs execute specific commands or scripts at predetermined times or intervals.
    - **HTTP CRONs**: These jobs make HTTP requests to specified URLs at set times or intervals, useful for triggering
      webhooks or remote tasks.

- **Preview Deployment**: A temporary deployment of a particular version of your application for testing and review
  purposes before it goes live. Preview deployments facilitate quality assurance, stakeholder review, and integration
  testing, enabling feedback and adjustments without impacting the production environment.
