title: Deploying Zaneops to your server (alpha)
description: 'Setup and install zaneops'
---

This guide will show how to deploy zaneops to your server, keep in mind that this is very alpha and is subject to change
and/or break, do not use this for production.

But if you like living on the edge üòé, feel free to test the app and report any bug encountered.
For now the features implemented are :

- **UI** : login/logout, creating project
- **API** : login/logout, creating,updating,archiving projects, creating services from docker images, archiving services,
updating services (by redeploying them). You can find a reference of the API
at https://zane.fredkiss.dev/docs/api-reference/openapi

## Prerequesites

You need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and be on a Unix machine.

## Process

### Go to the folder where you want to install zaneops

This can be any folder, but in this setup we will choose `/var/www/zaneops` :

```shell
mkdir -p /var/www/zaneops 
cd /var/www/zaneops
```

### Download the makefile for the project :

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/main/deploy.mk > Makefile
```

### Launch the setup process :

```shell
make setup
```

After this step, you should have a folder looking like this :

import {FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- zaneops
    - .fluentd/
    - temporalio
        - config
            - development.yaml
        - entrypoint.sh
    - docker-stack.prod-http.yaml
    - docker-stack.prod.yaml
    - .env
    - Makefile

</FileTree>

### Update environment variables in `.env`

please modify the contents to better suit your needs :

```shell
# This is an EXAMPLE, don't copy this in production
IMAGE_VERSION=alpha # zaneops version to install
ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY=/var/www/zaneops # where you will install zaneops 
ZANE_DB_USER=zane
ZANE_DB_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" # ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE CHANGE THIS ‚ö†Ô∏è
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 64)" # A secret key used by the API to hash tokens, this need to be at least 64 chars long
ROOT_DOMAIN=zaneops.local # The root domain which will be used to generate domains for applications
ZANE_APP_DOMAIN=app.zaneops.local # the domain where the zaneops dashboard will be installed 
```

#### How is each env variable used

1. `IMAGE_VERSION` : used to tell which version of zaneops to install
2. `ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY` : Used for telling where is the directory where zaneops will be installed
3. `ZANE_DB_USER` / `ZANE_DB_PASSWORD` : credentials used for authenticating to DB where zaneops is installed
4. `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` :
 1. This is used by the API to do many things, such as hashing user session tokens, read more
here  https://stackoverflow.com/a/47117966/10322846
 2. This needs to be really secure and at least 64 chars for good mesure, you can use a tool
like `openssl`
to generate a strong password, ex: `openssl rand -base64 64`
5. `ROOT_DOMAIN` :
 1. ZaneOps will use this domain to generate subdomains for the web apps deployed with zaneops, like
this: `my-web-app.zaneops.local`
 2. The domain in itself won't be used for anything else, you may use the root domain to put the zaneops there
6. `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` :
 1. ZaneOps will use this domain as the access point where it will be installed and accessible, once deployed you
will be able to access the dashboard using this domain.

### Deploy zaneops

```shell
make deploy
```

### Create your first user to login to the dashboard

```shell
make create-user
```

### Shutting down zaneops

```shell
make remove
```

### Deleting zaneops & all resources created by it

```shell
make delete-resources
```

### In case you want to deploy locally

In case you don't want to deploy to a server online and want to test instead
on your local machine, add the host for zaneops to your `/etc/hosts` config :

```shell
nano /etc/hosts

# add the hosts
127.0.0.1       app.zaneops.local
```

If you deploy any service to zaneops, you'll need to add the domain to this file.
